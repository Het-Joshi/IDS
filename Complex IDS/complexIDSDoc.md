## ComplexIDS Documentation

### Overview
The ComplexIDS script is an advanced Intrusion Detection System (IDS) implemented in Python using the Scapy library. It includes enhanced detection rules and logging functionality to provide comprehensive monitoring of network traffic.

### Features
1. Customizable detection rules for various types of suspicious activity.
2. Logging of detected events to a file for analysis and reporting.
3. Real-time alerting for detected suspicious activity.

### Usage
1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Python and the Scapy library installed on your system.

2. **Running the Script**: Execute the script `complexIDS.py` using Python:

```python3
python complexIDS.py
```

3. **Monitoring Network Traffic**: The IDS will start capturing network packets and analyzing them against predefined rules.

4. **Alerting and Logging**: Whenever suspicious activity is detected, the IDS will print alert messages to the console and log the events to a file (`ids_log.txt`) for further analysis.

### Customization
You can customize the IDS by modifying the following aspects:
- Detection rules: Update the predefined rules or add new rules to match specific patterns of suspicious activity.
- Logging mechanism: Customize the format and destination of log entries to suit your requirements.
- Alerting mechanism: Integrate with external systems or services for more advanced alerting capabilities.

### Example Usage
- Monitoring network traffic in a corporate environment to detect and prevent potential security breaches.
- Conducting research or analysis on network behavior and security threats.
